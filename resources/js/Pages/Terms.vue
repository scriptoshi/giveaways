				<div>
					To be eligible to use the Platform, you must at least be of legal age or 18+.

				To have access to some features of the Platform, you need to create an account with
				sleep (“Account”). <br />
				When you create an Account, you signify that you are of legal age or 18+ and that
				all information you provide is accurate, up-to-date, truthful, and complete. You
				have the sole responsibility for all activities within your Account. <br />
				sleep is committed to maintaining the security of the Platform and Users' Accounts
				and implements industry-standard protection for its services. We will not be held
				liable if your password and/or Account are stolen or used by a third party without
				your authorization. You, therefore, agree to keep your password safe and secure and
				always update your account information. You shall not set up multiple Accounts,
				unless at the express permission of sleep and still subject to the Terms and any
				additional terms as sleep deem fit. <br />
				A sleep Account can only be used by the Account registrant. You cannot lend,
				transfer, or sell your Account or information to another party and must not use
				another User’s Account without their consent. If we have previously banned or
				suspended your Account, you cannot create a new Account unless unsuspended or
				unbanned. <br />
				sleep reserves the right to suspend, freeze or cancel an Account used by persons
				other than the Account registrant. If you become aware or suspect unauthorized or
				suspicious use of your Account, username or password, notify sleep immediately.
